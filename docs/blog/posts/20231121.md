To access your Zomro VPS using WSL’s Ubuntu terminal:

1. Open the Ubuntu terminal via the Windows Start menu.
2. Use the `ssh` command to connect to your VPS:

   ```bash
   ssh your_username@your_server_ip

## Locating File Paths in Ubuntu CLI

Navigating and identifying file paths in Ubuntu is essential for transferring files. Use these commands for efficient file management:

### 1. **Present Working Directory (`pwd`)**

   Displays the absolute path of the current directory:

   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

### 2. **List Directory Contents (`ls`)**

   Shows files and directories in the current location:

   ```bash
   ls
   ```

### 3. **Find a File (`find`)**

   Searches for a file in the system:

   ```bash
   find / -name example.txt
   ```

### 4. **Change Directory (`cd`)**

   Navigates through directories:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/directory
   ```

### 5. **Access Windows Files**

   WSL allows access to Windows files via `/mnt`. For example:

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Desktop
   ```

## File Transfer Methods Using SCP

### Using SCP (Secure Copy)

The `scp` command securely copies files between WSL and Windows.

#### Syntax

```bash
scp username@source:/path/to/source/file /path/to/destination/
```

#### Example: Copy Files from WSL to Windows

To copy screenshots from a remote VPS to your Windows Desktop:

```bash
scp root@45.88.107.136:/root/zomro-selenium-base/screenshots/* "/mnt/c/Users/Harminder Nijjar/Desktop/"
```

This command transfers all files from the VPS directory to the specified Windows Desktop folder.
