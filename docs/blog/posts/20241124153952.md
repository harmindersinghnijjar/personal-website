I recently started playing games on Xbox Cloud Gaming on PC, and I noticed that the aim assist with [reWASD](https://github.com/EugeneSunrise/reWASD) wasn't as powerful as I had initially expected. I decided to use [Crosshair.AHK](https://github.com/harmindersinghnijjar/2020-2021-ahk-dump/blob/4dc11db4c5cd3d40db562ad3690c4d2599a27e5c/crosshair.ahk#L4) to help me aim better. Crosshair.AHK is a simple script that displays a crosshair on your screen to help you aim better in games. In this post, I will show you how to use Crosshair.AHK to assist with aiming in Fortnite on Xbox Cloud Gaming.

The crosshair styles range from simple dots to more complex designs, giving you plenty of options to customize your crosshair to your liking.
