# My First Digital Art Blog Post

While sitting on the dining table drinking a [Celsius Peach Vibe](https://www.celsius.com/products/peach-vibe/), I decided to create a quick digital drawing of the can next to a container of JIF peanut butter. The drawing was done on my MobiScribe WAVE using the stylus that came with the device. The MobiScribe WAVE is a great tool for digital art, and I enjoy using it for quick sketches and drawings.
