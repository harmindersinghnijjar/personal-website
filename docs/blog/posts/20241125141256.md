# My First Digital Art Blog Post

While sitting on the dining table drinking a [Celsius Peach Vibe](https://amzn.to/499IQbh), I decided to create a quick digital drawing of the can next to a container of [JIF peanut butter](https://amzn.to/3B13TAn). The drawing was done on my [MobiScribe WAVE](https://amzn.to/3CEDYyM) using the stylus that came with the device. The MobiScribe WAVE is a great tool for digital art, and I enjoy using it for quick sketches and drawings.
