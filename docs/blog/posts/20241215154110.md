## **Installing ROS 1 on Raspberry Pi**

Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source framework widely used for robotic applications. This guide walks you through installing ROS 1 (Noetic) on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu. ROS 1 Noetic is the recommended version for Raspberry Pi and supports Ubuntu 20.04.

### **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Raspberry Pi 4 or later with at least 4GB of RAM (8GB is recommended for larger projects).
- Ubuntu 20.04 installed on the Raspberry Pi (Desktop or Server version).
- Internet connection for downloading and installing packages.

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Raspberry Pi**

1. **Update and Upgrade System Packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y curl gnupg2 lsb-release
   ```

### **Step 2: Configure ROS Repositories**

1. **Add the ROS Repository Key**:
   ```bash
   sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

2. **Add the ROS Noetic Repository**:
   ```bash
   echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
   ```

3. **Update Package List**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

### **Step 3: Install ROS 1 Noetic**

1. **Install the Full ROS Desktop Version**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y ros-noetic-desktop-full
   ```

2. **Verify the Installation**:
   Check the installed ROS version:
   ```bash
   rosversion -d
   ```
   This should return `noetic`.

### **Step 4: Initialize ROS Environment**

1. **Set Up ROS Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Install rosdep**:
   rosdep is a dependency management tool for ROS:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3-rosdep
   ```

3. **Initialize rosdep**:
   ```bash
   sudo rosdep init
   rosdep update
   ```

### **Step 5: Test the ROS Installation**

1. **Run roscore**:
   Start the ROS master process:
   ```bash
   roscore
   ```
   Leave this terminal open.

2. **Open a New Terminal and Run turtlesim**:
   Launch a simple simulation:
   ```bash
   rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
   ```

3. **Move the Turtle**:
   Open another terminal and control the turtle using:
   ```bash
   rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
   ```
   Use the arrow keys to move the turtle in the simulation.

### **Step 6: Install Additional ROS Tools**

To enhance your ROS setup, install the following:

1. **catkin Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3-catkin-tools
   ```

2. **Common ROS Packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y ros-noetic-rviz ros-noetic-rqt ros-noetic-rqt-common-plugins
   ```

3. **GPIO and Hardware Libraries (for Pi-specific projects)**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y wiringpi pigpio
   ```

### **Troubleshooting**

- **Issue**: `rosdep` not initializing properly.  
  **Fix**: Ensure network connectivity and retry:
  ```bash
  sudo rosdep init
  rosdep update
  ```

- **Issue**: ROS environment variables not set.  
  **Fix**: Manually source the ROS setup file:
  ```bash
  source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
  ```

### **Conclusion**

Your Raspberry Pi is now configured with ROS 1 Noetic, ready for robotic projects. With this setup, you can develop and deploy various ROS packages, integrate hardware, and experiment with advanced robotic systems.

Happy building!
