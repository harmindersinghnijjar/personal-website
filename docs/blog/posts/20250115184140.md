# Setting Up Browser Use with Botright

Automating web browsing while remaining undetected is critical for various use cases like scraping, testing, or automation. This guide shows you how to set up **Browser Use** with **Botright**, a robust library for stealth browsing and captcha solving.

## Why Use Botright?

[Botright](https://github.com/Vinyzu/Botright) enhances stealth browsing by leveraging techniques like fingerprint masking and AI-driven captcha solving. It integrates seamlessly with Playwright, making it perfect for stealthy automation tasks.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools and dependencies are installed:

1. **Python 3.11 or Higher**: Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **pip**: Included with Python.
3. **Browser Use**: The main framework.
4. **Botright**: For stealth features and advanced automation.

### Install Required Packages

Run the following commands to set up your environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use
cd browser-use

# Install uv for environment management
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.11

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate # For Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows

# Install Browser Use with development dependencies
uv pip install . ."[dev]"

# Install Botright
pip install botright
playwright install
```

## Implementation

Follow these steps to integrate Botright with Browser Use:

### 1. Update `main.py`

Replace the Playwright browser initialization with Botright’s initialization. Here’s the updated `main.py`:

```python
import asyncio
import botright

async def main():
    # Initialize Botright with enhanced stealth options
    botright_client = await botright.Botright(headless=False)

    # Launch a browser instance
    browser = await botright_client.new_browser()

    # Open a new page
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Navigate to a website
    await page.goto("https://example.com")

    # Perform browser actions (e.g., take a screenshot)
    await page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")
    print("Screenshot saved!")

    # Close the browser and Botright client
    await browser.close()
    await botright_client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Set up required API keys by copying the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
BOTRIGHT_API_KEY=your_botright_api_key
```

### 3. Run the Script

Run your updated `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. What Happens?

1. **Browser Initialization**: Botright launches a Chromium-based browser instance with stealth enhancements.
2. **Website Navigation**: The browser navigates to the specified URL (`https://example.com`).
3. **Screenshot Capture**: A screenshot is taken and saved as `screenshot.png`.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Botright Logs**:
   Use `print` statements or Botright's built-in logging for debugging.
2. **Browser Errors**:
   Verify the installed version of Playwright and Botright.
3. **Environment Issues**:
   Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct API keys.

## Advanced Features

### Captcha Solving

To solve captchas, use Botright's built-in methods. Example:

```python
await page.solve_captcha()
```

### Fingerprint Masking

Botright automatically handles fingerprint masking. To customize this, refer to the [Botright documentation](https://botright.readthedocs.io/).

## Conclusion

By integrating Botright with Browser Use, you unlock advanced stealth browsing capabilities ideal for sensitive automation tasks. This setup provides a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as integrating AI-based analysis or multi-page navigation workflows.
