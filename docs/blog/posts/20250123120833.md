## Introduction

In this guide, we’ll walk through setting up the `roboclaw_ros` node in ROS Noetic using Docker. This approach ensures a clean, consistent environment for development and deployment while leveraging Docker's flexibility. We'll cover everything from creating the Docker image to running the node with the correct configurations.

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

1. **Docker Installed**: Docker must be installed and operational on your system.  
2. **Hardware Setup**:
   - A Roboclaw motor controller connected to `/dev/ttyACM0`.  
   - Encoders configured for your robot’s specific dimensions.  
3. **Dependencies Installed**:
   - The `roboclaw_driver` library for ROS.  
   - Python libraries like `pyserial` for communication.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Pull the Base Docker Image

Start by pulling the base Docker image for ROS Noetic:

```bash
sudo docker pull arm64v8/ros:noetic-ros-base
```

---

### 2. Run a Container and Install ROS Noetic Components

Launch a container from the base image:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --name ros_noetic_container --rm arm64v8/ros:noetic-ros-base
```

Inside the container, update and install required packages:

```bash
apt update
apt install -y ros-noetic-rosbridge-server ros-noetic-tf python3-serial python3-pip
pip3 install diagnostic-updater
```

---

### 3. Create and Mount a Workspace

To persist your workspace across sessions, create a workspace on your host machine and mount it in the container:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_noetic_ws/src
sudo docker run -it --name ros_noetic_container --rm -v ~/ros_noetic_ws:/root/ros_noetic_ws arm64v8/ros:noetic-ros-base
```

Inside the container, initialize the workspace:

```bash
cd /root/ros_noetic_ws
catkin_make
```

---

### 4. Clone the `roboclaw_ros` Repository

Clone the repository into the workspace:

```bash
cd /root/ros_noetic_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/DoanNguyenTrong/roboclaw_ros.git
```

---

### 5. Build the Workspace

Return to the root of the workspace and build it:

```bash
cd /root/ros_noetic_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

---

### 6. Save the Docker Image

To save your container for future use, commit it as a new image:

```bash
sudo docker commit ros_noetic_container ros_noetic_saved
```

Run this saved image with automatic restart enabled:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --name ros_noetic_container --restart always ros_noetic_saved
```

---

## Running the `roboclaw_ros` Node

To run the `roboclaw_ros` node, use the following steps:

### 1. Start the Container

Start the container with the saved image:

```bash
sudo docker start -ai ros_noetic_container
```

### 2. Launch the Node

Inside the container, run the launch file:

```bash
roslaunch roboclaw_node roboclaw.launch
```

---

## Testing the Node

To verify the node's functionality:

1. **Publish Commands to `/cmd_vel`:**

   ```bash
   rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.1}}'
   ```

2. **Monitor Output:**

   Check odometry data on `/odom`:

   ```bash
   rostopic echo /odom
   ```

---

## Viewing Docker Folder Structure

To view the folder structure inside the container, use:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it ros_noetic_container bash
cd /root/ros_noetic_ws
tree
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides a straightforward approach to setting up and running the `roboclaw_ros` node in a ROS Noetic Docker environment. Docker ensures consistency and portability, making it an ideal choice for robotics development. By following these steps, you can integrate Roboclaw into your robotic system efficiently.
