## Introduction

Docker is an essential tool for robotics development, offering quick prototyping, environment isolation, and streamlined deployment. However, managing containers effectivelyâ€”especially with ROS (Robot Operating System)â€”can be complex. This guide highlights best practices for saving Docker images, removing unused resources, enabling GUI and Bluetooth in containers, and ensuring seamless ROS integration for robotics projects.

## Key Topics Covered

- Saving and tagging Docker images for reproducibility  
- Cleaning up unused images and resources  
- Running Docker containers with GUI and peripheral support  
- Setting up ROS workspaces inside containers  
- Debugging common integration issues

## 1. Saving Docker Containers as Images

**Why Save Docker Containers?**

- Preserve your work after container modifications.  
- Quickly replicate development environments for prototyping or deployment.  

**Steps to Save an Image:**

1. Stop the container:
   ```bash
   sudo docker stop <container_name>
   ```

2. Commit the container to an image:
   ```bash
   sudo docker commit <container_id> <new_image_name>
   ```

3. Verify the saved image:
   ```bash
   sudo docker images
   ```

**Example:**
```bash
sudo docker commit 96a9ad78d1e6 roboclaw_v02
```

## 2. Removing Unused Images and Containers

**Why Clean Up?**

- Free up disk space.  
- Reduce clutter from unused or dangling images.  

**Commands:**

1. List dangling images:
   ```bash
   sudo docker images -f dangling=true
   ```

2. Remove dangling images:
   ```bash
   sudo docker image prune -f
   ```

3. Remove specific images:
   ```bash
   sudo docker rmi <image_id>
   ```

4. Remove stopped containers:
   ```bash
   sudo docker container prune
   ```

## 3. Running Containers with GUI and Peripheral Support

**Why Enable GUI and Peripherals?**

Robotics projects often require visualization tools like RViz and peripheral support for devices such as Xbox controllers or Bluetooth sensors. Docker flags ensure seamless integration.

**Command Example:**
```bash
sudo docker run -it --name roboclaw_v02 \
    --net=host \
    --privileged \
    --device=/dev/input/js0:/dev/input/js0 \
    --device=/dev/input/event0:/dev/input/event0 \
    -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    roboclaw_v02
```

**Explanation of Flags:**

- `--net=host`: Enables network communication between container and host.  
- `--privileged`: Grants access to host devices (e.g., Bluetooth).  
- `--device`: Maps input devices for peripherals like controllers.  
- `-v`: Mounts directories for GUI and device access.

## 4. Setting Up a ROS Workspace in Docker

**Why Use a Mounted Workspace?**

- Edit code on the host machine while executing it inside the container.  
- Persist changes across container restarts.  

**Steps:**

1. Run the container with a mounted workspace:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run -it --name <container_name> \
       -v ~/ros_ws:/root/ros_ws \
       <base_image>
   ```

2. Inside the container, initialize the ROS workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros_ws
   catkin_make
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

---

## 5. Running ROS Nodes and Debugging

### Starting `roscore`:

1. Attach to the container:
   ```bash
   sudo docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
   ```

2. Start `roscore`:
   ```bash
   roscore
   ```

### Running ROS Nodes:

1. Source the workspace:
   ```bash
   source ~/ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
   ```

2. Run the node:
   ```bash
   rosrun roboclaw_node xbox_teleop_odom.py
   ```

---

## 6. Debugging Common Issues

### Issue: "Master Not Found"
- Ensure `roscore` is running in the same container.

### Issue: "Device Not Found"
- Verify input device mapping:
   ```bash
   ls /dev/input/js0
   ```

### Issue: "ROS_PACKAGE_PATH Missing"
- Set the workspace path:
   ```bash
   export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/root/ros_ws/src:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
   ```

## Conclusion

By mastering these Docker and ROS workflows, you can create efficient and portable robotics development environments. Whether itâ€™s saving images, enabling peripherals, or debugging nodes, these practices ensure a robust foundation for prototyping and deployment.
