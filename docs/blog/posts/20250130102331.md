## **Introduction**  

With ROS 1 Noetic and ROS 2 Foxy running on the same system, it’s possible to bridge topics between them. This allows controlling a **RoboClaw motor controller** (running on ROS 1) using **ROS 2 commands**. This guide walks you through setting up the **ros1_bridge** and sending commands to the RoboClaw-controlled robot from ROS 2.

## **Key Topics Covered**  

- Running the RoboClaw node in ROS 1  
- Setting up the ROS 1-ROS 2 bridge  
- Sending velocity commands from ROS 2  
- Debugging issues  

---

## **1. Launching the RoboClaw Node in ROS 1**  

Make sure ROS 1 Noetic is **sourced** and start the RoboClaw node:  

```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
roslaunch roboclaw_node roboclaw.launch
```

Check if the **/cmd_vel** topic is available in ROS 1:  

```bash
rostopic list
```

You should see `/cmd_vel` in the list.

To verify if the node is working, try publishing a command directly from ROS 1:  

```bash
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.1}}'
```

If the robot moves, the RoboClaw node is working correctly.

## **2. Setting Up the ROS 1-ROS 2 Bridge**  

Since ROS 1 and ROS 2 use different communication protocols, we need to bridge them.

### **Step 1: Install the Bridge**  

Ensure both ROS 1 and ROS 2 are sourced:  

```bash
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

Install `ros1_bridge`:  

```bash
sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros1-bridge
```

### **Step 2: Run the Bridge**  

```bash
ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge
```

This will automatically bridge compatible topics between ROS 1 and ROS 2.

---

## **3. Sending Commands from ROS 2 to RoboClaw**  

Now that the bridge is running, switch to a new terminal and **source ROS 2**:  

```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

Check if the **/cmd_vel** topic is being bridged in ROS 2:  

```bash
ros2 topic list
```

If `/cmd_vel` appears, you can **publish a movement command from ROS 2**:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.1}}"
```

This should **move the robot** as if the command came from ROS 1.

## **4. Debugging Common Issues**  

### **Issue 1: ROS 1 and ROS 2 Variables Overlapping**  
**Solution:** Open separate terminals for ROS 1 and ROS 2, and source them separately.

### **Issue 2: The Bridge Doesn’t Forward /cmd_vel**  
**Solution:** Restart the bridge and verify that both ROS versions are sourced properly.

### **Issue 3: RoboClaw Doesn’t Respond to Commands**  
**Solution:** Ensure the RoboClaw node is running, and check `/cmd_vel` in ROS 1 using:

```bash
rostopic echo /cmd_vel
```

## **Conclusion**  

By following this guide, you can successfully **control your RoboClaw-powered robot from ROS 2** while it runs on **ROS 1 Noetic**. The **ros1_bridge** ensures seamless communication, allowing hybrid ROS applications.  

With this setup, you can integrate **ROS 2-based navigation stacks** with older ROS 1 hardware.
