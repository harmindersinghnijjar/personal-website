## Setup & Stability Tips

1. **Clamp placement matters**: Attach near desk legs for maximum rigidity.
2. **Balance the center of gravity**: Align the Prompter’s center over the pivot point.
3. **Secure cables**: Loop HDMI/USB cables to avoid accidental tugs.
4. **Avoid full extension**: Arms hold more weight when compressed.
