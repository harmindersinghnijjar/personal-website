## Installing Ubuntu 20.04 on Raspberry Pi for ROS Noetic

![Ubuntu 20.04 Raspberry Pi](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/91f43b54-Focal%20Fossa%2020.04.svg)

I needed a reliable OS for a Raspberry Pi project involving [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic), which only runs on Ubuntu 20.04. The issue? Raspberry Pi Imager doesn’t offer Ubuntu 20.04 anymore. Here's how I solved it by flashing the official preinstalled image manually.

## ✅ Why Ubuntu 20.04?

ROS Noetic is the final and most stable version of ROS 1, and it's officially supported only on **Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)**. Using any other version could cause dependency headaches or compatibility issues with packages.

## 📥 Downloading the Correct Image

Ubuntu provides a preinstalled server image built specifically for Raspberry Pi. I used the following:

➡️ **Image**: [`ubuntu-20.04.5-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz`](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/focal/release/ubuntu-20.04.5-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz)

This image is perfect for Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5.

## 🖥️ Flashing with Raspberry Pi Imager

Once you have the `.img.xz` file downloaded:

1. Open **Raspberry Pi Imager**
2. Click **“Choose OS”** → **“Use custom”**
3. Select the `.img.xz` file
4. Choose your SD card under **“Storage”**
5. Click **“Write”**

Optional: Before first boot, you can enable SSH by placing an empty file named `ssh` in the boot partition of the SD card.

## 🧠 Optional: Install a GUI

By default, the image is command-line only. You can install a desktop if needed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xubuntu-desktop
```

I personally prefer XFCE via `xubuntu-desktop` for its lightweight footprint.

## 🚀 Next Steps: Install ROS Noetic

Once Ubuntu 20.04 is running, you're ready to install ROS Noetic and start building your robot.
