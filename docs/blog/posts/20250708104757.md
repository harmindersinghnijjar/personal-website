# Understanding Azure Geographies, Regions, Availability Zones, and Core Services

## 1. What are Geographies? How many Geographies does Azure have? Write their names.

An **Azure geography** is an area of the world that contains at minimum one Azure region. Azure is available or coming soon in the following geographies: United States, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Azure Government, Asia Pacific, Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Austria, Denmark, Europe, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Africa, Israel, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia.

## 2. What are Regions and Region Pairs?

**Azure Regions** are sets of physical facilities that include datacenters and networking infrastructure. There are over 60 Azure regions worldwide.

**Region Pairs** are Azure regions linked with another region within the same geography. They support geo-replication, geo-redundancy, and disaster recovery.

## 3. What Regions are available in the US? What Region is the closest to CBC?

In the United States, available Azure regions include:
- Central US
- East US
- East US 2
- North Central US
- South Central US
- West US
- West US 2
- West US 3

The region closest to CBC is **West US 2**, located in Washington.

## 4. What are the Availability Zones?

**Availability Zones** are unique physical locations within a region. Each zone has its own power, cooling, and network to reduce the risk of single points of failure. They are usually within 100 km of one another to minimize outages caused by regional issues.

## 5. What are the Availability Sets?

**Availability Sets** are groups of virtual machines distributed across multiple fault domains to lower the chance of simultaneous failures.

## 6. What is a Virtual Machine?

A **Virtual Machine** is a software-based computer that emulates the functions of a physical computer.

## 7. What is a Hypervisor?

A **Hypervisor** is a software layer that helps create and manage virtual machines.

## 8. What are the services provided by Azure?

Azure provides services including:
- AI & Machine Learning
- Analytics
- Compute
- Databases
- Developer Tools
