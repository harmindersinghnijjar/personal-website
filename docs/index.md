Welcome to my personal documentation site, a curated collection of notes, guides, and insights that I have found valuable. It is my hope that you will find these resources equally beneficial.  

Please note that this site is a continuous work in progress, with new content regularly added and existing content frequently updated. The information provided is based on my personal experiences and perspectives, which may not align with every individual's circumstances. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome, and I encourage you to share your thoughts.  

## Projects  

Each year, I will undertake a series of projects with defined deadlines. This site serves as a platform to document my progress, share insights, and reflect on the outcomes of these endeavors. If you are interested in collaborating on a project or have a project idea, please feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nuJfCWCxby).

Upon completion, projects will be archived for future reference, so be sure to explore the archive section for a record of past work.  

## Blog  

The [blog](/blog) section features a variety of posts on topics that capture my interest. These include tutorials, guides, opinion pieces, and other content that I hope will provide value and inspiration.
